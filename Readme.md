# AnonEcho

AnonEcho is a decentralized social media plugin that allows users to post anonymous messages to all websites.<br/>
<br/>
For now, it is available for anonymous comments on X.<br/>
<br/>
Currently this comment plug-in is completely decentralized and we are using AO as backend.
<br/>
We are developing to support multiple networks (Solana evm) and multiple applications (reddit, Weibo). 
<br/>
We hope that AnonEcho can connect various traditional social platforms and become a cross-application anonymous social network.

We will support more platforms soon.
